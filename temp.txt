The Covert Channel Educational Analysis Protocol (CCEAP) 
is a simple network protocol designed for teaching 
covert channels (network steganography) to professionals and students.

The protocol is explicitly vulnerable against several hiding patterns,
 i.e. patterns that represent hiding methods (steganographic methods that create covert channels).
  The protocol's structure is simple and self-explanatory and
   its implementation is kept at a minimum level of code lines to make it especially accessible to students. 
   The documentation of the protocol and the tool can be found here. In addition, there is an academic paper available for download.
