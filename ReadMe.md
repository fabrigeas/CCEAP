##Theme of the Thesis DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF CCEAP USER INTERFACE


## My Planning

because I need to be done with this project aasp, i will be working extensively hard,
thus instead of the 12 weeks allocated, I will do only 10.

Thus i must be done before june, so as to have enaught time to prepare exams.

## Planning

1 familiarize with test CCEAP:(1 week until 9 April)

	- test CCEAT
	- based on CCEAT:
		- create script program hello world
		- create script program that takes user parameters
	- learn Makefile
	- alter the code
	- run with remote hosts

2 research: until 16 April

	- search as much as possible about covert channels
	- search similar CCEAP
	- search available tools that display command line results as GUI
	- how to write a program that runs on windows and Unix

3 Design: until 1 Mai

	- create mockups, wireframes, sketches
	- create GUI Hello world
	- translate sketched program into GUI 
	- read user inputs
	- translate inputs into cmdline parameters
