## Abstract

	This Bachelor thesis discusses the development of a graphical user interface program as an interface to a command line program CCEAP.
CCEAP (Covert Channel Educational Analysis Protocol) is a networking protocol in the form of a command line program to help learn/teach covert channels and hiding patterns.
The cceap program is currently executed from the command line, by starting a cceap-server with a given port number of a computer, then on another command line starting the cceap-client program with the IP address and port number of the computer where the server is running. The client is started with some other parameters that correspond to the cceapâ€™s protocol settings.
	The first section of this thesis is a discussion about what cceap is and the related concepts connected to it. Additional background information required to understand the purpose of cceap are also discussed in this section. Then some limitations of the cceap that lead to the need for a complementary graphical user interface are presented.
	The second section discusses the implementation phase of the Graphical User interface tool. Then a complete discussion on the implementation of the GUI tool with some of the important portions of the code followed by a discussion of some problems/issues faced during the implementation of the program as well as the solutions to some of the problems.
	In the last section, extensions to the GUI tool i.e. are presented. This refers to the features that could be added to the program during future development potentially by other students that might be involved in the evolution of CCEAP.
